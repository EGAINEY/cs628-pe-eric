## Input
There are three methods of user input in the TodoList application. These include the text field for adding a task, the "Add Task" button, and the "Delete Task" button.

## Process
When a user fills out the text field and clicks the "Add Task" button, the todo item is automatically incremented with a task number, it is added to the list of tasks, and the page refreshes to render the updated tasks list. Similarly, when the "Delete Task" button is clicked the task is removed from the list, the task numbers are updated, and the page refreshes to render the updated tasks list.

## Output
The output is a constantly accurate list of task that is rendered to the screen.
