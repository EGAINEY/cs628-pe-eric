## Input
There are two methods of user input in the Movie List application for this week. The first, is accomplished through the drop down select list. This defaults to the "All Genres" option, but is capable of producing a list with all unique genres in the movie array. The second, is the user's ability to click any of the movie cards.

## Process
When a unique genre is chosen, the array is filtered to only movies with that specific genre. When a movie card is clicked, an alert is called.

## Output
The output is an updated list of movies that populate to the user interface. The user is able to select a different genre if desired, to recieve a different list of movies. If a user clicks a movie card, the alert pop up appears on the user interface and displays the title of the selected movie.
