## Input
There are three methods of user input in the Cities Application. These include the text fields for adding a city (name, country, and population), the "Add City" button, and clicking on a city name in the cities list.

## Process
When a user fills out the text fields and clicks the "Add City" button, the new city is automatically assigned an ID, added to the list, and the page updates to display the new city. Similarly, when a user clicks on a city name in the list, the application retrieves the cityâ€™s details and renders them below the list.

## Output
The output is a constantly accurate list of cities and their details, dynamically rendered to the screen.
