## Input
By definition, the Resume application does not fit the IPO model. There is no input for the user on our single page React application. It serves constant static information.

## Process
There is also no process portion for this application. There is no code to perform any actions.

## Output
Similarly to the above, there is no output for our static app. It simply displays the same information when someone visits the page. I suppose the html web page that is served, could be considered output.
